## About

**NullGravity Labs** is an independent, research-driven lab focused on building  
**experimental open-source projects** for learning, exploration, and fun.

We don’t chase trends or hype.  
We build because we’re curious.

- 🎬 Media, culture & community-driven platforms

## Philosophy

> Break the defaults.  
> Question the limits.  
> Build for the joy of building.

NullGravity is not about removing gravity —  
it’s about **not being held down by it**.
