## About

**NullGravity Labs** is an independent, research-driven lab focused on building  
**experimental open-source projects** for learning, exploration, and fun.

We don’t chase trends or hype.  
We build because we’re curious.

---

- 🎬 Media, culture & community-driven platforms  
- 🤖 AI-assisted workflows & automation

- 📱 Android, mobile & platform-level projects  

Everything here is **open-source**, **iterative**, and **built in public**.

## Philosophy

> Break the defaults.  
> Question the limits.

it’s about **not being held down by it**.
